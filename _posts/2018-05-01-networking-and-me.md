title: Networking and Me
categories: ['philosophy']

 Starting from college first day I was told about the importance of networking. I do understand knowing the right set of people will help you throughout your life. But the problem with me is interacting with those *right set of people*

 I find it very difficult to befriend these people not because they are rude. But the guilt that I'm interacting with them so that they would help me in the future. Voluntarily getting close to a person is something I find very difficult. A handful of people with whom I'm close, the friendship grew over time. Friendship should grow over time not something we should force. 
 
 If we need to grow our network we need to reach out to people. But I always feel guilty If I reach out to a person with an intention of growing my network.  What will the person think if he know I'm in touch with him just to grow my network. I'm in a deadlock. Because of this I had no seniors who were close to me in college. I struggled a lot without the guidence of seniors. But when I was a senior, I interacted with few juniors often. This was very easy for me because I had no hidden intentions. Just senior-junior relationship. Why was the reverse  a herculean task for me ?  **Is networking really a difficult task or is just for me?.**

 >  There is some self-interest behind every friendship. There is no friendship without self-interests. This is a bitter truth. - **Chanakya**

Is this really true ?
